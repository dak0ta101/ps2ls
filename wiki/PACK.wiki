= PACK =

`PACK` files are uncompressed files archives.

== Format ==

`PACK` files are split into `CHUNK`s.

{{{
typedef unsigned char byte_t;
}}}

== CHUNK ==

{{{
struct chunk_t
{
    unsigned int next_chunk_offset;
    unsigned int file_count;
    file_t* files;
};
}}}

`next_chunk_offset` defines the absolute offset to the beginning of the next `CHUNK` block.  If the value is `0`, then this is the last `CHUNK` in this file.

`file_count` defines the number of files contained in this block.

`files` is an array of `file_t`s of size `chunk_t::file_count`.

== FILE ==

{{{
struct file_t
{
    unsigned int name_length;
    char* name;
    unsigned int offset;
    unsigned int length;
    unsigned int crc32;
};
}}}
